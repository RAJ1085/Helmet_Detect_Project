# Helmet_Detect_Project
Helmet Detection using YOLOv8  This project focuses on the automated detection of helmets using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) deep learning object detection model. The primary objective is to identify whether individuals, particularly motorbike riders or workers in hazardous environments, are wearing helmets or not.
